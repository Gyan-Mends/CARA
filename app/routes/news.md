Introduction
On 29th October, the world observes the United Nations International Day of Care and Support, a global recognition of the vital role that care and support systems play in sustaining families, communities, and economies.
Established by the UN in 2023, this day calls attention to the often-invisible labor that underpins society: the work of caregivers. It invites governments, institutions, and citizens to invest in care systems as essential infrastructure,  not as acts of charity.

Why the Day Matters
Every act of care,  from a mother nurturing her newborn, to a teacher guiding a child, to a nurse supporting a patient, or a family caregiver assisting an elder, contributes to the resilience and wellbeing of our world.
Yet across Africa, millions of caregivers, especially women and youth, provide this critical labor without recognition, fair pay, or social protection. The UN International Day of Care and Support urges nations to acknowledge that care is central to achieving equality, inclusion, and sustainable development.
‚ÄúCare keeps societies alive ‚Äî it is the unseen foundation of progress.‚Äù

Spotlight: Garden City Special School, Kumasi
As part of this year‚Äôs commemoration, CARA visited the Garden City Special School in Asokore Mampong, Kumasi, a place where care is lived every day through dedication, patience, and love.
During the engagement, the Principal of the school shared a moving reflection:
‚ÄúFor my 24 years in special education, this is the first time I am hearing about the UN International Day of Care and Support. If there is truly a global day for care, then it must translate into tangible support for those who are actually providing care.‚Äù
Her words echo the voices of countless caregivers across Ghana and the continent, those whose unseen work sustains our most vulnerable, yet whose welfare remains overlooked.
Through this visit, CARA reaffirmed its commitment to shining a light on care work within educational and institutional settings and advocating for policy attention to caregivers‚Äô welfare, training, and career progression.

A Call to Action
As Africa continues to pursue inclusive growth, the care economy must take its rightful place at the heart of development.
‚Ä¢	Governments must invest in care infrastructure and training.
‚Ä¢	Communities must support caregivers through recognition and shared responsibility.
‚Ä¢	Institutions must design policies that protect and empower care workers.
CARA believes that by valuing care, we build stronger families, more inclusive societies, and resilient economies.
